## Contribution
Since the project is not maintained for a long time errors might come on the latest version of java. I created it using Java 8. Feel free to raise an issue and send a pull request. 
### Setting up environment
* Download JDK 8 and Netbeans IDE since the entire project is made using Netbeans GUI builder.
* Open the project using Netbeans and start working.
